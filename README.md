NBA CCG Bot

Card collecting game written using discord.py; users can collect and trade their favorite NBA players from a currently limited roster pool. Basic function: users draw players from 
a tracked pool, complete with headshots, stats, and more. Card draws operate with a cooldown on a per-server basis. Player collections are not shared between servers (otherwise
all players would quickly become unavailable).

TO BE ADDED

Expanded roster, database/SQL storage, head-to-head simulations (team vs team)
